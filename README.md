# Web Development Project 6 - *SpaceX Launch Visualizer*

Submitted by: **Kelvin Mathew**

This web app: **This project is a dynamic and interactive web application that visualizes launch data for SpaceX missions. Built with React, it fetches real-time information from the public SpaceX v5 API and presents it in a sleek, modern interface featuring a "liquid glass" aesthetic. The dashboard provides an at-a-glance summary of key statistics and allows users to explore the complete history of SpaceX launches through a detailed, filterable list.**
